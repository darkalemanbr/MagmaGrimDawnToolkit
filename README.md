MAGMA Grim Dawn Toolkit
=======================

**Development status:** hiatus*

**Since the official release of Grim Dawn is just a few days from now, I'll see if Crate is going to release the game editor. If they indeed do, the development here will (probably) be ceased. If they release the game and refuse or delay the release of the editor, the development will continue.*

## What works?
* GDLib: implemented methods are working, but expect all sorts of bugs!
* GD Explorer: working. Can open ARC v3 files, list, rename and extract its entries.
Also expect many bugs!
